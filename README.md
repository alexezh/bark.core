# Bark, not Scratch

Bark is an environment for game development which is bit more advanced than Scratch (or Minecraft) but way less advanced than Roblox.

The first program I've written long time ago was Snake game in MS Basic 1.0 on Yamaha MSX. The game was simple but so was all other applications
at that time. When I compare experience to current environments, I feel that it is much harder to make an interesting game in few hours. Scratch is 
the best option but the programming experience is very limited. 

The goal for Bark is to bridge the gap and enable Basic style coding experience in a browser. I actually thought of implementing Basic as a language
but decided against it for now. The level of JavaScript required so far is simple enough.

Key features:
- runtime is in a single file. You can copy bark.html to local disk and run it
- editor integrated into enviroment. 
- support for tile-based games (tile game maps, sprites etc)

Upcoming features
- improved animations and physics
